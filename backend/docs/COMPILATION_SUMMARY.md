## 🎯 For Gemini AI Brainstorming

### Main Document to Share
**`docs/GEMINI_SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE.md`** - This is the complete knowledge base

### What It Contains for Brainstorming

#### Google AI Integration Opportunities
1. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** - 90% cost reduction on STT
2. **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** - 93% cost reduction on TTS
3. **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** - Alternative to GPT-4o
4. **Google Calendar Integration** - Real appointment booking
5. **Dialogflow CX** - Structured conversation flows
6. **Contact Center AI (CCAI)** - Enterprise features
7. **Vertex AI** - Custom models and RAG
8. **Cloud Functions** - Serverless integrations

#### Key Questions for Discussion
- Should we replace OpenAI with Google AI stack?
- How to reduce costs while maintaining <1s latency?
- Which Google AI features from the YouTube video are most valuable?
- How to add business-specific knowledge with RAG?
- Should we use Dialogflow CX or keep free-form conversation?

## 📊 Current System Stats

### Performance
- **Connection Time**: 2-3 seconds (recently optimized from 10s)
- **Response Latency**: <100ms (OpenAI Realtime API)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully operational

### Costs
- **Per Call (3 min)**: $0.95
- **At 100 calls/day**: $2,841/month
- **Potential Savings with Google AI**: 85-90% ($324/month)

### Architecture
- **Current**: Twilio → OpenAI Realtime API (all-in-one STT+LLM+TTS)
- **Proposed**: Twilio → Google STT → Gemini → Google TTS
- **Benefit**: Much lower cost, similar quality, slightly higher latency
