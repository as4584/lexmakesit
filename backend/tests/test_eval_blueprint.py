"""
🧠 Copilot context:
This file acts as an eval system for the AI haircut concierge bot.
- It tests conversation flows offline (no API calls).
- Each fixture under docs/samples/*.json represents a scenario.
- We simulate assistant responses and tool calls.
- Each new feature must include:
  1. a fixture file (sample dialogue)
  2. a pytest function to validate logic and order of actions
  3. assertions for confirmation → booking → readback

Copilot, when I ask for new tests, generate both:
- a JSON fixture (docs/samples/)
- a pytest test function following the same structure.
