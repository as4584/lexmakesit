# Frutiger Aero Overhaul Complete

I have completely refactored the site to strictly adhere to the Frutiger Aero aesthetic and fixed all responsiveness issues.

## 1. Glassmorphism Architecture
- **Floating Panels**: Every section (Hero, Portfolio, Testimonials, Contact) is now contained within a `glass-panel` with:
    - `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.14)`
    - `backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(140%)`
    - Soft inner glow and subtle white borders.
- **Consistent Spacing**: Automatic top/bottom spacing and horizontal centering with a max-width of 1000px.

## 2. Authentic Color Palette
- **Ocean & Aqua**: Replaced harsh purples with `Soft Ocean Blue` (#60aaff → #3d84ff) and `Aqua` highlights.
- **Navy Text**: Used `#0a1020` for high-contrast, readable text that fits the "corporate/clean" aesthetic of Frutiger Aero.

## 3. Responsive Engineering
- **Fluid Typography**: Used `clamp()` for all headings and text, ensuring they scale smoothly from mobile to desktop.
- **Grid Layouts**: The portfolio and testimonials use `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))` to stack perfectly on mobile without squishing.
- **Mobile Navigation**: The navbar is slimmer and fully responsive.

## 4. Classic Aero Buttons
- **Liquid Metal**: Buttons now feature a gradient blue glass look with a soft glow and hover scale effect.
- **Performance**: Transitions are set to `120ms` for that snappy, premium feel.

## 5. Clean Codebase
- **Modular CSS**: Split styles into `global.css`, `background.css`, `glass.css`, `buttons.css`, and `components.css`.
- **No Inline Styles**: `index.html` is now pure semantic HTML with classes.
- **Optimized JS**: `aero.js` now handles bubble creation with constant speed (120s) and fixed scaling.

The site is now a perfect example of the Frutiger Aero design language: clean, optimistic, and high-tech.
